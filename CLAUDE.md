# RabAI — rules for working in this repo

A Torah learning assistant that answers from inside the Orthodox mesorah. Read
`docs/founding-spec.md` before changing anything.

## Rules

- **The board decides what is Torah content.** Never mark a work, edition, core-premise
  change, or reference answer as `approved` yourself. Only record approvals the maintainer
  reports from the rabbinic board, with `approved_by` and `approved_on`, plus a line in
  `docs/approvals-log.md`.
- **Whitelist editions, never collections.** Never import a whole library (for example, all of
  Sefaria). Each edition is listed in `canon/canon.yaml` on its own. Check
  `canon/excluded.yaml` before adding any translation.
- **Retrieval reads only the whitelist** that `python3 tools/validate.py --whitelist` prints.
- **Licensed texts are never committed.** `library/` is gitignored.
- **Do not invent sources.** Citations in this repo are suggestions for reviewers to confirm,
  and must say so until a reviewer has.
- Run `python3 tools/validate.py` before every commit. CI runs it too.
- Keep the docs in step with the data: a new tag value goes in `canon/vocabulary.yaml`, and a
  new decision goes in `docs/founding-spec.md`.

## Writing style for anything a user or a rav will read

Plain English. Translate Hebrew and Aramaic terms the first time unless the reader is clearly
comfortable with them. Respectful toward every Jewish community, and toward people who hold
other views.
